## Abstract

The research was conducted to identify the factors influencing college students' satisfaction with their college experience. Firstly,  the study focused on the literature review to determine relevant factors previously studied in the literature. Then,  the survey analysis examined three main independent factors related to college students' satisfaction: Major Satisfaction, Social Self-Efficacy, and Academic Performance. The findings of the study suggested that the most important factor affecting students' satisfaction with their college experience is their satisfaction with their chosen major. This means that students who are satisfied with their chosen major are more likely to be overall satisfied with their college experience. It's worth noting that while the study found that major satisfaction is the most crucial factor, it doesn't mean that other factors, such as Social Self-Efficacy, Academic Performance, and Campus Life Satisfaction, are not necessary. Based on these findings, it is recommended that students prioritize their major satisfaction when making college choices to maximize their overall satisfaction with their college experience.
