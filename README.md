# METU STUDENTSâ€™ COLLEGE LIFE SATISFACTION

## Abstract

The research was conducted to identify the factors that influence college students' satisfaction with their  college  experience.  Firstly,  the  study  was  focused  on  the  literature  review  to  determine relevant  factors  that  have  been  previously  studied  in  the  literature.  Then,  the  survey  analysis examined three main independent factors that have been found to be related to college students' satisfaction: Major Satisfaction, Social Self-Efficacy, and Academic Performance. The findings of the study suggested that the most important factor affecting students' satisfaction with their college experience is their satisfaction with their chosen major. This means that students who are satisfied with  the  major  they  have  chosen  are  more  likely  to  be  overall  satisfied  with  their  college experience. It's worth noting that, while the study found that major satisfaction is the most crucial factor, it doesn't mean that other factors such as Social Self-Efficacy, Academic Performance, and Campus Life Satisfaction are not important. Based on these findings, it is recommend that students prioritize their major satisfaction when making college choices in order to maximize their overall satisfaction with their college experience.
